# ⚡ HIT THE BEAT

A minimalist, Scrolly-native timing game built for vertical, scroll-based play.

Built on top of the **Solana dApp Scaffold**, using an AI-assisted, no-code approach.

## 🎮 OVERVIEW

HIT THE BEAT is a one-tap timing game where both the needle and the target zone
move continuously.

Your goal is simple:
tap at the exact moment the moving needle overlaps the moving zone.

Each successful hit increases your score and makes the game harder.
One miss ends the run.
## 🕹️ HOW TO PLAY

1. Watch the moving needle and the moving target zone.
2. Tap (or click) anywhere on the screen.
3. A tap is successful if the needle is inside the target zone.
4. Each successful tap:
   - Increases your score
   - Shrinks the target zone
5. Miss once and the game ends.
6. Restart and try to beat your best score.
## 📜 RULES

- Both the needle and target zone move left to right.
- The target zone becomes smaller after every successful hit.
- Game speed increases gradually as your score increases.
- Only one mistake is allowed per run.
## 🏁 WIN & LOSE CONDITIONS

WIN:
- There is no fixed win condition.
- The objective is to achieve the highest possible score.

LOSE:
- Tapping when the needle is outside the target zone immediately ends the game.
